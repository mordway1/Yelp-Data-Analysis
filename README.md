# Yelp-Data-Analysis

With trusted local business information, photos and reviews, Yelp provides a one-stop platform for consumers to discover local businesses. For business owners, itâ€™s a critical marketing platform to generate buzz. A business thrives when they receive high user ratings, high number of reviews, and positive reviews, to name a few.
